   <h2>BIO</h2>
<div class="container">
<p>
    As a young adult, I cultivated a vision 
    for a career in the dynamic realm of technology. Pursuing this 
    passion, I earned an Associate's degree in Visual Communications 
    with a specialization in Interactive Media. Post-graduation, I 
    prioritized my family before 
    directing my focus towards professional endeavors. Once I was ready to commence my 
    journey in the workforce as a receptionist, I embraced every chance 
    for growth and progression. This dedication propelled me into a 
    Quality Assurance role within an esteemed app development team, 
    igniting my aspiration for a future transition into a developer 
    position.

    After four years of working as a QA professional, 
    I recognized the need to proactively seize opportunities for 
    personal and professional growth. Motivated by this realization,
     I enrolled in Grand Circus' .NET full stack course, where I am 
     currently immersed in mastering Object-Oriented Programming 
     principles through hands-on project development.

    Outside of my professional pursuits, I engage in activities that 
    stimulate both my mind and body. I am an avid chess enthusiast, 
    challenging myself to enhance my skills through online play and 
    friendly matches with peers. Additionally, I maintain a disciplined 
    running regimen, aiming to participate in multiple 5k races
     throughout the summer months. These hobbies not only invigorate 
     me but also serve as platforms for setting and achieving personal
      milestones.

    In my career aspirations, I am dedicated to securing a developer 
    position where I can apply the evolving skills I am mastering,
     while also actively pursuing continuous learning and skill 
     development. My objective is to not only contribute effectively 
     to a team but also to continually increase my value as an asset.
    I am dedicated to a path of advancement, eagerly anticipating the 
    achievement of future goals beyond this initial milestone.
